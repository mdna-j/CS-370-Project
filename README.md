**Petabyte** – A Virtual Pet Desktop App

Petabyte is a Tamagotchi-inspired virtual pet desktop application built in Python using the Kivy framework. Users care for a digital pet whose behavior dynamically reflects the user's interactions and habits. The pet responds emotionally to both user input and tracked activity, offering a gamified way to encourage positive habits.
